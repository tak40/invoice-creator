## Overview

This project is a solo endeavor from the Scrimba bootcamp, conceived and built from the ground up. Its core purpose is to facilitate users in generating invoices efficiently. The application leans heavily on vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, ensuring a seamless and intuitive web experience.

## Design Mockups

The design blueprints for this project are hosted on Figma. Interested readers can peruse them [here](https://www.figma.com/file/ejHmm5h6VhSW7dQgRgOmlk/Invoice-Creator?node-id=0%3A1&t=nxSAEKc5XGTtzEmR-1).

## Initial Challenges

During the early stages of the project, I aimed to get a working version up and running. I frequently switched between Scrimba's materials and other online guides. This back-and-forth, along with getting to grips with JavaScript, often left me puzzled and stalled.

## Refactoring Journey

### The refactoring was influenced by three primary reasons:
1. The existing code, while functional, was far from optimal in terms of readability and structure.
2. The stretch goals, initially perceived as challenging, mandated a more organized approach.
3. "How can I elevate this bootcamp project?"

### The main goals during this phase were:
- Streamlining the JavaScript logic.
- Ensuring mobile responsiveness.
- Achieving the outlined stretch goals.
- Formulating and realizing personal stretch goals.

## Key Enhancements

- **Redesigning**: Influenced by the user-friendly design elements of popular web apps like DoorDash, the UI was overhauled to be more intuitive.
- **Dynamic Input**: Transitioned from a static list manager to a dynamic task and invoice generator, where users could input tasks, quantities, and prices.
- **Modal Implementation**: Integrated modals using the `<dialog>` tag post a workshop at Scrimba, adding a layer of sophistication.
- **Beyond Stretch Goals**: The project was constantly evolved to not just meet but surpass the stretch goals, aiming for a production-grade web application standard.
