## Overview

This project is a solo endeavor from the Scrimba bootcamp, conceived and built from the ground up. Its core purpose is to facilitate users in generating invoices efficiently. The application leans heavily on vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, ensuring a seamless and intuitive web experience.

## Requirements

### Initial Requirements
- Array to hold requested tasks
- Buttons to add a task to array
- Display data from array; should update when the array changes
- Charge only once for each task
- Update total amount each time a task gets added
- Button to "send invoice" (reset)

### Stretch Goals
- Enter tasks
- Text field for task
- Select menu with cost options
- Add new task and cost to the array and update task list
- Remove tasks

## Design Mockups

The design blueprints for this project are hosted on Figma. Interested readers can peruse them [here](https://www.figma.com/file/ejHmm5h6VhSW7dQgRgOmlk/Invoice-Creator?node-id=0%3A1&t=nxSAEKc5XGTtzEmR-1).

## Initial Challenges

During the early stages of the project, I aimed to get a working version up and running. I frequently switched between Scrimba's materials and other online guides. This back-and-forth, along with getting to grips with JavaScript, often left me puzzled and stalled.

To give you an idea, here's a glimpse of my initial "spaghetti code" (haha):

```javascript
// This function displays a selected task in the task list.
function displaySelectedTask(taskName, taskPrice) {
    const namesSection = document.getElementById('task-names');
    const pricesSection = document.getElementById('task-prices');
    const newTaskNameParagraph = document.createElement('p');
    const newTaskNameSpan = document.createElement('span');

    newTaskNameSpan.classList.add('task-name-style');
    newTaskNameSpan.textContent = taskName;

    newTaskNameParagraph.appendChild(newTaskNameSpan);
    namesSection.appendChild(newTaskNameParagraph);

    const newTaskPriceParagraph = document.createElement('p');
    const dollarSignSpan = document.createElement('span');
    dollarSignSpan.classList.add('dollar-sign-style');
    dollarSignSpan.textContent = "$";
    newTaskPriceParagraph.appendChild(dollarSignSpan);

    const newTaskPriceSpan = document.createElement('span');
    newTaskPriceSpan.classList.add('task-price-style'); 
    newTaskPriceSpan.textContent = taskPrice;
    newTaskPriceParagraph.appendChild(newTaskPriceSpan);
    pricesSection.appendChild(newTaskPriceParagraph); 
}
```


## Refactoring Journey

### The refactoring was influenced by three primary reasons:
1. The existing code, while functional, was far from optimal in terms of readability and structure.
2. The stretch goals, initially perceived as challenging, mandated a more organized approach.
3. "How can I elevate this bootcamp project?"

### The main goals during this phase were:
- Streamlining the JavaScript logic.
- Ensuring mobile responsiveness.
- Achieving the outlined stretch goals.
- Formulating and realizing personal stretch goals.

### My Blueprint for JavaScript Refactoring

After thoughtful consideration, I established a blueprint for my refactoring process (as of now):

1. Get the DOM: Identify the main elements to manipulate.
2. Event Handlers: Pinpoint interactive elements like buttons or links.
3. Core Functions: Define essential functions based on the DOM and interactions.
4. Separate Concerns: Break down and categorize functions for clarity and maintainability.

By following this structured approach, I was able to achieve a more efficient and organized application.

## What's New

 - Update 11-04-2023

The latest version of Invoice Creator introduces a series of updates and optimizations to enhance functionality, improve code quality, and boost user experience. Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s been improved:

### Code Refactoring and Consistency
- **Decimal Point Consistency**: Now, all monetary values across the application are standardized to two decimal places, using the `toFixed(2)` method, ensuring uniformity and precision.
- **Custom Alert System**: Moved away from default browser alerts to a custom, visually appealing alert system for error messages.
- **Modal Input Retention**: User input is now preserved when modals are closed, preventing data loss and improving user experience.
- **Remove Button Refactoring**: Transitioned remove button interactions from using IDs to data attributes, enhancing maintainability and readability.

### CSS and HTML Enhancements
- **Semantic HTML Refactoring**: Embraced semantic HTML tags to improve accessibility and document structure.
- **CSS Class Refactoring**: Reduced redundancy by streamlining styling with unified class names, although a few rule sets still contain unique classes that perform identical functions. This aspect will be addressed in future updates.
- **Descendant Selector Usage**: Simplified the CSS by employing descendant selectors where applicable.
- **Nested CSS Implementation**: Adopted nested CSS rules for an organized and scalable styling approach.

### Feature Enhancements
- **Alert Dialogs**: Users are now greeted with custom-designed alerts that match the application's aesthetic for a consistent user interface.

Hereâ€™s a preview of the new custom alert dialog amd Nexted CSS implementation:

![Custom Alert Dialog](./images/custom-alert.png)

```css
.action-btn {
    background-color: var(--light-gray-bg-color);
    border: none;
    color: var(--primary-text-color);
    font-size: 1rem;
    border-radius: var(--small-border-radius);
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: var(--primary-transition);
        &:hover {
            background-color: var(--dark-gray-bg-color);
        }
        &:active {
            background-color: var(--active-dark-gray-bg-color);
        }
}
```

By focusing on these areas, Invoice Creator is steadily moving towards cleaner code, DRY principles, and a more polished product. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to refine and enhance the application.


## Key Enhancements

- **E-commerce Inspired Design**: Drawing inspiration from prominent e-commerce platforms, including the likes of DoorDash and others, the user interface was redesigned for a more intuitive and familiar feel. Below is an image showcasing the e-commerce inspired design:

- **Dynamic Task Entry**: The task entry section underwent a major revamp. Now, not only can users input tasks, but they also have the capability to specify the price and quantity. This dynamic entry format simplifies the invoice creation process, as depicted in the image above.

- **Modal Implementation**: Integrated modals using the `<dialog>` tag post a workshop at Scrimba, adding a layer of sophistication. 

    Here's a glimpse into the modal structure:

    ```html
        <!-- Invoice Modal -->
    <dialog id="invoice-modal" class="invoice-modal">
        <form method="dialog">
            <fieldset>
                <legend>Send Invoice</legend>
                <label for="email">Email:</label>
                <input type="email" id="email" class="modal-email-input" required>
                <label for="message">Message:</label>
                <textarea id="message" rows="4" required></textarea>
                <menu>
                    <button id="submit-modal-btn" class="modal-btn modal-send-invoice-btn" type="submit">Send Invoice</button>
                    <button id="cancel-modal-btn" class="modal-btn modal-cancel-btn" type="reset">Cancel</button>
                </menu>
            </fieldset>
        </form>
    </dialog>

    <!-- Confirmation Modal -->
    <dialog id="confirmation-modal" class="confirmation-modal">
        <p>Invoice Sent Successfully!</p>
        <button id="close-confirm-modal-btn" class="modal-btn modal-close-btn">OK</button>
    </dialog>    
    ```

- **Beyond Stretch Goals**: The project was constantly evolved to not just meet but surpass the stretch goals, aiming for a production-grade web application standard.
